                            banks, but does not use heat sinks. This is known as "hot-banking", and should be expected
                            to cause some level of module damage. That said, with the three MRPs, this ship should be

                            hull. Not quite a match for the firepower, or the tightness of the clustering of the
                            hardpoints, but better turn rate and thus ability to apply the damage. </p>

                            human NPCs in the game and obliterating them. Perfectly capable of taking on multiple full
                            wings NPC ships at the same time and soloing High Intensity Conflict zones. </p>
                        <p class="card-text combat-card-text">This build takes a different approach to managing the heat
                            from the Shield Cell Banks, here it is to use thermal vent on the lasers, effectively using
                            the enemy ships as your heat sinks. There are many other loadouts that the Vette can fit and
                            work very well with.</p>
